      <h2>Hobbies!</h2>
      <p>Here are three of my favorite hobbies, that will give you an idea as to why I feel I am a great candidate.</p>
        <ol class="mildlyimportant">
          <li>Hanging out with my family.</li>
          <li>Baking</li>
          <li>Rocket League</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="column">
          <h4>Hanging out with my family.</h4>

            <div class="background2">
              <p>My family give me the drive and passion to be better. My biggest goal in life is to create something that they will be proud of.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h4>Baking!</h4>
            <img src="img/orengecardimum.jpeg" alt="picture of an orenge cardimum bun">
            <div class="background2">
              <p>I've been cooking most of my life. First as a necessity, then eventually as a short loved career. In that time i was a production baker and cake decorator, which expanded my love for the art. With that knowledge and passion ingrained into my soul i understand the importance of time.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="column">
          <h4>Rocket League!</h4>
            <img src="img/rocketleague.jpeg" alt="image of the video game Rocket League">
            <div class="background2">
              <p>I've been playing Rocket League for years with some former roomates, turned best friends. We are pretty ok, depending on the game type, with our ranks fluctuating between mid gold to high diamond. One thing we do really well, as a team, is communication. <span class="important">Communication</span> is key when we are making the late season push for diamond or grand champ rewards. The biggest life lesson i can take away from the game is teamwork, and working well with a team by communicating well.</p>
