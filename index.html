        <h4>Hanging out with my family.</h4>

      <div class="column">
        <h4>Baking!</h4>
        <p>I've been cooking most of my life. First as a necessity, then eventually as a short loved career. In that time i was a production baker and cake decorator, which expanded my love for the art. With that knowledge and passion ingrained into my soul i understand the importance of time.</p>
